ISSUES FOUND WITH THIS CODE:

1. Imports too many external libraries e.g. presto, plotting libraries etc. These will be read
   by python interpreter before the script is executed. The more imports to process, the longer
   this will take.
2. Multiple errors being reports with respct to the following:

	2. a)
	SOURCE: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/scipy/optimize/minpack.py:393: 
	ERROR : RuntimeWarning: Number of calls to function has reached maxfev = 1000.
	EFFECT: The least squares optimization call isn't finding the optimal parameters (local minimum since using Levenberg Marquardt).
			This means incorrect parameters will be returned after 1000 calls to perform the least squares optimization.
    
    2. b)
    SOURCE: operations_new.py:199: 
    ERROR : RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide IN err = y - (abs(maximum)*exp((-((x-expect)/sigma)**2)/2)+(bg))
    EFFECT: should be minimal, but indicates incorrect parameters being supplied to scipy's leastsq function.
    
    2. c) 
    SOURCE: N/A
    ERROR : NaN values being returned as scores.
    EFFECT: Our machine learning classifiers cannot deal with NaN values.
    
    2. c) 
    SOURCE: N/A
    ERROR : NaN values being returned as scores.
    EFFECT: Our machine learning classifiers cannot deal with NaN values.
    
    2. d)
    SOURCE: test_22.py
    ERROR : ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (50) (9). Happening where,
            t1t2_diff = t2_result[3] - (t1_result[3] + minbg - p.std()) - differences of gaussian fits t1 and t2. The arrays
            being used are of different sizes. 
    EFFECT: The code will fail on certain candidates producing no scores.
    
3.	Code problems:

	3. a) Chi-squared computed incorrectly in:
	
		def fit_sine(ydata,nmax,width):
		fit_sine_sqr(ydata,nmax,width):
		
		Note that a width parameter was passed to both these functions, which actually
		held the pulse width. But this parameter was never used.
		
4. I've given up keeping track, there are too many!
