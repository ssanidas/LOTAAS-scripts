For Vlad's script to work, you need to have created a .wgetrc file in your home area, readable only by you (chmod 0600), that will contain two lines with the username and password as follows.

user=sanidas
password=mypassword

giving a -h to the script will provide a usage description.

Usage with a csv file:

1)You get the csv file containing all the observations in a cycle by using dbview and giving the following query

SELECT fo.FILENAME, fo.FILESIZE, fo.CREATION_DATE, fo.URI, obs.ObservationID
FROM AWOPER.BeamformedDataProduct dp,
AWOPER.FileObject fo,
AWOPER.Observation obs,
AWOPER.FORMEDDATAPRODUCT$OBSERVATIONS dp_obs
WHERE fo.data_object = dp.object_id
AND fo.isValid > 0
AND dp.isValid > 0
AND dp."+PROJECT" = SYS_CONTEXT('AWCONTEXT','PROJECTID')
AND dp_obs.object_id = dp.object_id
AND dp_obs.column_value = obs.object_id
UNION
SELECT fo.FILENAME, fo.FILESIZE, fo.CREATION_DATE, fo.URI, obs.ObservationID
FROM AWOPER.PulpDataProduct dp,
AWOPER.FileObject fo,
AWOPER.Observation obs,
AWOPER.PulpDataProduct$Observations dp_obs
WHERE fo.data_object = dp.object_id
AND fo.isValid > 0
AND dp.isValid > 0
AND dp."+PROJECT" = SYS_CONTEXT('AWCONTEXT','PROJECTID')
AND dp_obs.object_id = dp.object_id
AND dp_obs.column_value = obs.object_id
UNION
SELECT fo.FILENAME, fo.FILESIZE, fo.CREATION_DATE, fo.URI, obs.ObservationID
FROM AWOPER.PulpSummaryDataProduct dp,
AWOPER.FileObject fo,
AWOPER.Observation obs,
AWOPER.UMMARYDATAPRODUCT$OBSERVATIONS dp_obs
WHERE fo.data_object = dp.object_id
AND fo.isValid > 0
AND dp.isValid > 0
AND dp."+PROJECT" = SYS_CONTEXT('AWCONTEXT','PROJECTID')
AND dp_obs.object_id = dp.object_id
AND dp_obs.column_value = obs.object_id
UNION
SELECT fo.FILENAME, fo.FILESIZE, fo.CREATION_DATE, fo.URI, pr.ObservationID
FROM AWOPER.UnspecifiedDataProduct dp,
AWOPER.FileObject fo,
AWOPER.UnspecifiedProcess pr
WHERE fo.data_object = dp.object_id
AND fo.isValid > 0
AND dp.isValid > 0
AND dp."+PROJECT" = SYS_CONTEXT('AWCONTEXT','PROJECTID')
AND dp.UnspecifiedProcess = pr.object_id

From that file, you select the lines that you want to download and store them in a new file, (i.e. download.txt)

Then you can use the script to get the data by using it like this

./lta-retrieve.py -u sanidas -f manual download.txt

2)Additional functionality added by Vlad Kondratiev

You can use the "global" csv file you have and request for specific pointings in the following way

./lta-retrieve.py -u sanidas -csvfile <file> <obsid1> <obsid2>
